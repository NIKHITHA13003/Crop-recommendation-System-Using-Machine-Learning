# Crop-recommendation-System-Using-Machine-Learning
This project aims to assist farmers in making informed crop choices based on various factors like soil type, climate, and historical crop data. By leveraging state-of-the-art machine learning algorithms, our system suggests the most suitable crops for cultivation, optimizing yield and resource utilization.
